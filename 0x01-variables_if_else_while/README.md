## Variables ,if,else,while
0. A function that assigns random number to the variable n each time it is executed .Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n ispositive or negative .If the number is greater than 0 : is poistive ,if it is zero : is zero, if the number isless than 0: isnegative ..followed by new line
1. A function that prints the assign random number to the variable n each time it is executed .Complete the source code in order to print whether the last digit stored in the variable n ispositive or negative .If the last digit n is greater than 5 : is greater than 5 ,if it is zero : is zero, if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0 : is less than 6 and not 0 .,.followed by new line
2. A program that prints alphabets in lowercase followed by new line. .All codes written in main function , only use putchar
3.  A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. only use putchar
4. A program that prints alphabets except q and e  in lowercase followed by new line. .All codes written in main function , only use putchar
