0. A function that concatenates two strings.This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte. Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
1. A function that concatenates two strings.The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.
2. A function that copies a string . Your function should work exactly like strncpy.
3. A function that compares two strings. Your function should work exactly like strcmp.
4. A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
5. A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6. A function that capitalizes all words of a string. Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }

7.A function that encodes a string into 1337. You can only use one if in your code .You can only use two loops in your code .Letters a and A should be replaced by 4 .Letters e and E should be replaced by 3. Letters o and O should be replaced by 0 .Letters t and T should be replaced by 7 .Letters l and L should be replaced by 1 .You are not allowed to use switch .You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
